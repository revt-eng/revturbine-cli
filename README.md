# revturbine-cli (`revturbine`)

Validate [RevTurbine](https://revturbine.com) **Config Files** and ship them to
a RevTurbine instance through the playbook-version lifecycle (draft → Release) —
from the terminal, the same operations the in-app studios perform.

`revturbine` is the command-line counterpart to the RevTurbine control plane. It
schema-validates a config offline, authenticates to an instance via the browser
(RFC 8628 device flow), and stages / launches configs as playbook versions so
every change is reviewable and rollback-able.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g @revturbine/cli   # global `revturbine` binary
# or run without installing:
npx @revturbine/cli --help
```

The published npm package is `@revturbine/cli`; the installed command is
`revturbine`.

Requires Node ≥ 22.13. Source builds use the npm 11.18.0 version declared in
`package.json`.

## Quick start

```bash
revturbine signup                             # create an account (email + password + emailed code)
revturbine login                              # authorize this machine (device flow)
revturbine download --live --save ./config.json
# …edit ./config.json…
revturbine validate ./config.json             # schema-validate locally (no network)
revturbine diff ./config.json --live          # what would change (no writes)
revturbine launch ./config.json               # upload, gate, and go live
```

`revturbine <command> --help` documents every flag.

## Version selectors

Commands that read a config name the version explicitly — there is no default:

| Selector | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<file>` / `--file <path>` | a local Config File |
| `--draft` | the tenant's single open draft (resolved automatically) |
| `--live` | the current live Release |
| `--release <id>` | a specific playbook version / Release |

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `signup` | Create an account headlessly: email + password, then an emailed one-time code to verify, then a token is stored. |
| `login` / `logout` | Device-flow auth; tokens stored at `~/.revturbine/credentials.json` (mode 0600). |
| `whoami` | The resolved instance, tenant, credentials source, and whether the stored token works. |
| `schema` | Emit the bundled `RevTurbineConfig` JSON schema (for agents to author against). |
| `docs` | Print the canonical documentation URL. |
| `download` | Fetch a config version (`--live` / `--draft` / `--release <id>`); `--save`, `--format flatbuffer`. |
| `validate` | Offline schema validation of a `<file>`, or the full server catalog against the open draft (`--draft`). |
| `diff` | Compare any two versions, first → second (dry-run, no writes). |
| `show <kind>` | Summary tables: `plans` · `entitlements` · `segments` · `placements` · `trials` for any version. |
| `upload` | Stage a Config File as the open draft. |
| `launch` | Take a config live: validate (launch gate) → submit → approve → deploy. `launch <file>` or `launch --draft`. |
| `discard` | Archive the open draft (`--yes`). |
| `restore` | Stage a draft that restores a past release from its frozen snapshot; `--launch` takes it live. Halts if a draft is open. |
| `status` | The live Release and the open draft, side by side. |
| `history` | The Release Version Log, newest first. |
| `preview` | The open draft's staged changes. |
| `evaluate` | Run the live config's placement/entitlement decisions for a user context. |

`--json` on read commands emits machine-readable output. Results go to stdout,
diagnostics to stderr.

## Exit-code classes

```
0  success
1  unexpected error (catch-all)
2  bad usage — unknown command, flag, argument, or missing version selector
3  authentication or permission denied
4  validation blocked (schema failure, blocking findings, unknown id)
5  conflict or stale state (e.g. a draft is already open)
6  network or transient failure
7  server error
```

## Schema validation

Validation is **mandatory** and runs fully offline against a vendored,
version-stamped snapshot of RevTurbine's `RevTurbineConfigSchema`
(`src/schema/`, regenerated from the canonical schema via
`npm run generate:schema`). The CLI never uploads a config it could not
validate. `revturbine --version` reports both the CLI version and the schema
snapshot version.
